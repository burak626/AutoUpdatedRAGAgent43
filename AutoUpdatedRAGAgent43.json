Additionally, we operate a traditional medical clinic in the Northeast of the U.S. dedicated to treating children with scoliosis.\n\nBefore we proceed with a potential collaboration, I have a few questions regarding the optimal platform for this dashboard development project. We are currently evaluating whether Google Sheets, Looker Studio, or an alternative platform like Airtable (leveraging n8n for integrations) would be best suited for building these dashboards. \n\nWe would greatly appreciate your professional insight into the advantages and disadvantages of each platform, particularly in the context of our specific needs for functionality, scalability, ease of use, and long-term effectiveness. Your expertise in this area would be invaluable in helping us select the most appropriate solution.\n\nLooking ahead, for the second phase of our integration, we anticipate needing assistance with automating many of these workflow processes. Furthermore, several months from now, we project requiring support with API integrations for an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system.\n\nCould you please let us know if these types of projects are within your area of expertise and if you have handled similar undertakings in the past?\n\n I would be happy to send you some documents outlining our processes in more detail to help familiarize you with our operations prior to a call.",

This will likely involve a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx or Caddy – please specify your preferred solution).\nSecurity & Best Practices:\n\n\nFirewall Configuration: Implement a robust firewall (e.g., UFW) to only allow necessary incoming traffic (SSH, HTTPS, and any other agreed-upon ports).\nSSH Authentication: Configure secure SSH access, ideally using key-based authentication (no password-based SSH access). We will provide an SSHpublickey.\nN8n Authentication: Set up basic username/password authentication for accessing the n8n web editor.\nDiscuss & Implement: We need to have a brief discussion about other relevant security considerations and implement agreed-upon best practices for a production server.\nDocumentation & Deliverables:\n\n\nComprehensive Documentation: Provide clear, concise documentation of the entire setup process, including:\nSSH credentials and instructions for access.\nn8n login credentials.\nLocation of key configuration files (Docker Compose, Nginx/Caddy config).\nInstructions on how to restart n8n, check logs, and perform basic troubleshooting.\nSteps for future n8n and system updates.\nDetails on the backup strategy (see point 6).\nAny relevant security measures implemented.\nConfirmation that SSL is working correctly.\nConfirmation of persistent data storage.\nBackup Strategy Discussion & Setup (Initial):\n\n\nDiscuss and recommend a robust backup strategy for the n8n data (PostgreSQL database, workflows, credentials).\nImplement an initial backup solution (e.g., DigitalOcean Droplet backups, or a script to back up the PostgreSQL database to a secure location). We are open to your recommendations here.\nPreferred Experience:\nProven experience with DigitalOcean Droplets and cloud server management.\nStrong expertise in Docker and Docker Compose.\nProficiency with PostgreSQL setup and management.\nExperience with Nginx or Caddy for reverse proxy and SSL configuration.\nSolid understanding of Linux server security best practices (firewalls, SSH hardening).\nPrior experience with n8n installations is a significant plus.\nExperience with GoHighLevel is a plus.  \nExcellent communication skills and ability to provide clear technical documentation.\nTimeline: We are looking to complete this setup within 1-3 business days of project award, assuming prompt communication and access.\nPotential for Ongoing Maintenance: Upon successful completion of this setup project, we would be interested in discussing a separate, ongoing maintenance or support contract for the n8n server, if that is a service you offer.\nPlease provide:\nYour proposed approach to the setup.\nAn estimated fixed price for the complete project.\nYour availability to start.\nExamples of similar past work if available.\nWe look forward to reviewing your proposals!",

It transcribes conversations in real time and, when the user makes a request, it triggers a webhook API call through n8n. The API returns the data, and the agent delivers it back to the caller within the conversation. The architecture is already built — what we need is someone to refine and finish it.\n\nScope of Work\n\n1.  API Replacement\n- Replace the current Zillow-based API (which is returning inaccurate data) with a more reliable and accurate data provider.\n- Potential alternatives could include Perplexity’s API or another trusted real estate data source.\n- Ensure API responses are properly integrated into the conversational flow without breaking the existing n8n architecture.\n\n2. Prompt Refinement in Retell\n- Fine-tune the conversational prompts to make the agent sound natural, professional, and human-like.\n- Ensure the flow avoids “walls” or dead ends during conversations.\n- Adjust phrasing for compliance (e.g., TCPA opt-in) and proper use of real estate terminology and abbreviations.\n- Smooth out edge cases where the agent might misinterpret or respond unnaturally.\n\n3. Testing & Iteration\n- Stress-test the agent with different conversation types to ensure accuracy and natural flow.\n- Debug and optimize any weak spots in the workflow.\n\nWho We’re Looking For:\n- Experience building voice AI agents on platforms like Retell AI or Vapi.\n- Strong background in API integration and data flow management.\n- Skilled with n8n, Make, or Zapier for workflow automation.\n- Comfortable with prompt engineering for conversational AI.\n- Bonus: Knowledge of real estate data sources and compliance requirements.\n\nDeliverables:\n\nA fully functional conversational AI agent that:\n1. Uses a reliable data API for real estate information.\n2. Flows smoothly and naturally during calls.\n3. Handles opt-in and compliance language correctly.\n4.

You won’t be the primary builder day-to-day, but you can take over and build an agent end-to-end if we decide a project needs it.\nEnd goal: Deploy AI agents that replace repetitive/manual tasks in our business while upskilling me—I want to learn how agents are designed, built, evaluated, and maintained so I can own future iterations.\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\n* Audit existing agents: Review architecture, prompts, tools, data flows, and logs. Identify root causes and quick wins.\n* Coach & guide fixes: Pair with me to debug, refine prompts/tool-calls, add guardrails, and improve reliability—without taking over the whole build.\n* Design new agents: Help with ideation, scoping, and technical design (capabilities, tools, context strategy, evaluation plan).\n* Standards & playbooks: Define best practices for prompting, evaluation, logging/monitoring, versioning, and cost/latency control.\n\n\nMust-have experience\n* Proven track record shipping LLM/agent systems (tool use, function calling, multi-tool orchestration).\n* Strong prompt engineering and structured outputs (JSON/JSON Schema), tool design, and context/RAG strategies.\n* Solid software engineering (Python and/or TypeScript/JavaScript), code review, testing, Git.\n* Extensive hands-on with n8n: robust workflow design, error handling/retries, credentials, webhooks, sub-workflows, queues/rate limits, and production hardening.\n* Production deployments on Railway: running microservices/workers/cron jobs, managing env vars & secrets, logs/metrics, and basic CI/CD.\n* Experience with other relevant platforms: at least one of Make/Zapier (workflow automation), Render/Vercel/Fly.io (app hosting), or LangChain/LangGraph (agent frameworks).\n* Excellent communicator and coach who transfers knowledge clearly.\n\nEngagement\n* Part-time, hourly. Start with a paid diagnostic + action plan, then weekly sessions + async reviews.\n* EU-friendly time overlap preferred. English required\n* Deliverables (initial phase)\n* Agent Audit Report: Issues, quick wins, prioritized roadmap.\n* Coaching Sessions: Live reviews + written follow-ups.\n* Automation Plan: Shortlist of manual processes to automate, ROI estimates, and success metrics.\n* Playbook: Checklists for prompts, testing, logging, release, and incident handling.\n\n\nSuccess looks like:\n* Deployed agents that meaningfully reduce manual work (hours/week saved or cycle-time reduction).\n* I can design, adjust, and ship agent updates independently.\n\nHow to apply\nPlease include:\n* A short note on two agent projects you’ve delivered (what they did, stack, your role, results).\n* Your hourly rate and weekly availability.\n* One paragraph on how you’d run a 60–90 min paid diagnostic for an agent with intermittent tool errors.",

If you're interested respond with just a few lines that you basically read everything, you believe it's possible, and the timeline... bonus if you've done something similar before. \n\n------\n\nWe’re looking for someone highly experienced with N8N and AI prompting to help us move our entire support system from gleap.com into a fully automated, AI-driven flow.\n\nWhen a customer sends us a message, the AI should be able to collect all the context it needs before replying. That means pulling details from Stripe about billing and plans, checking our internal database and systems, looking at previous conversations, and even reviewing other activity or data points that could be relevant.\n\nOnce it has the context, the AI should respond in a natural and conversational way, as if a human agent were behind the keyboard. The tone really matters here...we want answers that feel warm, clear, and personal, not robotic.\n\nFrom there, the AI should route each request in the right direction. If it’s a feature suggestion, it should log that suggestion and thank the customer and let them know that the feature was launched once it does. If it’s a bug report, it should create a detailed ticket in our tasks board, let the customer know it’s being looked at, and post the full context for the developer. And if it’s a how-to or general question, the AI should simply answer it on the spot with the right information.\n\nFor bugs especially, the AI will also need to manage the updates. Whenever a developer comments on or updates the ticket, the AI should pass that message back to the customer. For example: “The team is discussing it and getting closer... thanks for your patience.” When the fix is complete, the AI should follow up with: “This should now be resolved. Please give it another try and let me know if it’s still an issue. If so, I’ll reopen the ticket for you.” If a ticket is taking longer than expected, the AI should check in with the customer every so often to reassure them: “Sorry for the delay, we’re still on it and I’ll keep you updated.”\n\nThe most important part of this flow is the loop. Nothing should ever fall through the cracks. Every question, bug, or feature request should be acknowledged, tracked, updated, and closed out with the customer... or reopened if needed. The AI should always be the one keeping the thread alive until the customer is truly satisfied.",

Our goal is to stand up a lightweight but powerful v1 system within 1–2 weeks that centralizes our brand knowledge, supports content creation workflows, and lays the groundwork for multi-channel distribution.\n\nNotion will be the primary hub for this MVP. Additional systems (distribution, scheduling, analytics) will follow in later phases. The immediate focus is speed to launch: we want a functional system that supports idea intake, content planning, and production immediately, with RSS feeds automated into Notion as inspiration fuel.\n\nObjectives\n\n- Create an organized brand repository in Notion for:\n   : Brand assets (logos, templates, design references)\n   : Messaging pillars, personas, product library\n   : Voice & tone guidelines, proof points, positioning docs\n- Set up an RSS / inspiration intake pipeline (via Make, Zapier, or n8n) to bring external content ideas directly into Notion.\n- Build a content calendar workflow in Notion:\n   : Calendar view for monthly editorial planning\n   : Kanban view for content stages (Idea → Draft → Review → Published)\n   : Metadata for personas, messaging pillars, campaigns, CTAs\n- Design a content production template library for blogs, LinkedIn posts, ad copy, landing pages, and decks.\n- Enable team collaboration in Notion: ownership, deadlines, review workflow.\n- Document a simple MVP process flow for ideation → content creation → publishing prep.\n- Provide clear recommendations for Phase 2: automating content distribution across LinkedIn, blog CMS, HubSpot/email, and analytics tracking.\n\nDeliverables (Phase 1, 1–2 Weeks)\n\n- Fully configured Notion workspace including:\n   : Brand Repository database\n   : Personas, Messaging Pillars, Product Library databases\n   : Inspiration / RSS intake database (automated feed integration live)\n   : Content Calendar database with relations, rollups, and views\n- 3–4 ready-to-use content templates (blog, social, ad, landing page)\n- Automation flow set up (RSS → Notion)\n- Documentation / Loom walkthrough of the system\n- Next-step recommendations for Phase 2 automation (distribution + analytics)\n\nDesired Skills\n\nMust-Have\n\n- Strong experience structuring systems in Notion (databases, relations, formulas, templates)\n- Expertise with automation platforms (Zapier, Make, n8n) to connect RSS feeds into Notion\n- Background in marketing operations / content workflows\n- Familiarity with SaaS and B2B marketing environments\n\nNice-to-Have\n\n- Knowledge of distribution automation (social schedulers, CMS, HubSpot)\n- Familiarity with analytics/UTM tracking for marketing performance\n- Experience integrating design assets (Figma, Canva) into brand libraries\n\nSuccess Criteria\n\n- System is live and usable within 1–2 weeks\n-Team can begin populating brand assets and content ideas immediately\n-Marketing team can run content planning and production out of Notion by end of project\n- RSS automation is live, feeding inspiration into the system\n- Documentation makes the system easy to maintain and extend\n\nWhy This Project Matters\n\nWe’re shifting to a repeatable, content-driven demand generation model.

Identify root causes and quick wins.\n* Coach & guide fixes: Pair with me to debug, refine prompts/tool-calls, add guardrails, and improve reliability—without taking over the whole build.\n* Design new agents: Help with ideation, scoping, and technical design (capabilities, tools, context strategy, evaluation plan).\n* Standards & playbooks: Define best practices for prompting, evaluation, logging/monitoring, versioning, and cost/latency control.\n\n\nMust-have experience\n* Proven track record shipping LLM/agent systems (tool use, function calling, multi-tool orchestration).\n* Strong prompt engineering and structured outputs (JSON/JSON Schema), tool design, and context/RAG strategies.\n* Solid software engineering (Python and/or TypeScript/JavaScript), code review, testing, Git.\n* Extensive hands-on with n8n: robust workflow design, error handling/retries, credentials, webhooks, sub-workflows, queues/rate limits, and production hardening.\n* Production deployments on Railway: running microservices/workers/cron jobs, managing env vars & secrets, logs/metrics, and basic CI/CD.\n* Experience with other relevant platforms: at least one of Make/Zapier (workflow automation), Render/Vercel/Fly.io (app hosting), or LangChain/LangGraph (agent frameworks).\n* Excellent communicator and coach who transfers knowledge clearly.\n\nEngagement\n* Part-time, hourly. Start with a paid diagnostic + action plan, then weekly sessions + async reviews.\n* EU-friendly time overlap preferred. English required\n* Deliverables (initial phase)\n* Agent Audit Report: Issues, quick wins, prioritized roadmap.\n* Coaching Sessions: Live reviews + written follow-ups.\n* Automation Plan: Shortlist of manual processes to automate, ROI estimates, and success metrics.\n* Playbook: Checklists for prompts, testing, logging, release, and incident handling.\n\n\nSuccess looks like:\n* Deployed agents that meaningfully reduce manual work (hours/week saved or cycle-time reduction).\n* I can design, adjust, and ship agent updates independently.\n\nHow to apply\nPlease include:\n* A short note on two agent projects you’ve delivered (what they did, stack, your role, results).\n* Your hourly rate and weekly availability.\n* One paragraph on how you’d run a 60–90 min paid diagnostic for an agent with intermittent tool errors.",

But we’re not growing as fast as we'd like—and we’re looking to change that...\n\nThat’s where you come in!\n\nThe Opportunity:\n\nWe're looking to hire a marketing-savvy team member who can help drive growth through:\n\n🧊 Cold Outreach – Lead generation, segmentation, and outbound campaigns via email and LinkedIn, calls, etc.\n\n⚙️ Systems & Automation – Use tools like n8n, Zapier, Make.com, PhantomBuster, etc. to build scalable, modular pipelines\n\n🛠️ Process Creation – Develop SOPs so campaigns aren’t reliant on one person\n\n📈 Experimentation & Data – Run, track, and iterate on campaigns based on clear metrics\n\nThis is not a generic marketing gig, it's a partnership. We’re looking for a systems thinker—someone who can take the seed of an idea (or a half-baked list) and build real-world leadgen machines around it.\n\nAnd we're looking to partner with somebody long term to help us grow to become the #1 organizations in our space—and we're already well on our way.\n\nOur partnerships include:\n\n- LearnDash\n- WPFusion\n- MemberPress\n- MemberMouse\n- Paid Memberships Pro\n- Memberium\n- Gamipress\n- FunnelKit\n\n...and other big players in our space.\n\nWhy We’re Hiring:\n\nRight now, cold email is tying our founder’s brain into a pretzel 🧠🥨. \n\nWe’ve got some promising lists of prospects, a fantastic reputation in our space with over 10+ years of experience, and lots of ideas—but not enough experience or availability to get consistent results. We’re also aware that the tools and APIs can get expensive fast, so we want to make sure we're using them strategically.\n\nOur goal is to grow ambitiously but not wastefully.\n\nIf you can help us stop “making it up as we go” and instead build repeatable, ROI-positive systems, then we want to hear from you.\n\nThe Ideal Candidate:\n\n✅ You've run successful outbound campaigns before\n✅ You're comfortable with omnichannel (email, socials, ads, etc.)\n✅ You're all about results\n✅ You know tools like Apify, Clay, Sales Navigator, Apollo, Instantly, Lemlist, n8n, etc.\n✅ You can build automation workflows competently and know how to work with APIs\n✅ You understand how to structure campaigns\n✅ You love AI and use it extensively\n✅ You can communicate clearly and own a process without needing micro-management\n✅ Bonus if you’ve worked with WordPress, membership sites, eLearning sites, etc.\n✅ Bonus if you can manage other sub-contractors for various activities that might be needed in your role (e.g. enrichment, automations building, etc.)\n\nWhat We Offer:\n\nA chance to work with two aligned but distinct businesses—MemberFix (services) and MemberHost (productized hosting), directly with the founders!\n\nA smart, lean and passionate team that moves quickly, takes extreme pride in the quality of their work and service, and values autonomy / flexibility.\n\nCompetitive pay that goes up very quickly if you generate real results. Our motto: pay people what they're worth.\n\nLong-term potential if it’s a good fit.... CMO ;)\n\nTo Apply:\n\nPlease share:\n\n- A quick intro and why this role interests you\n\n- One or two examples of cold outreach systems you’ve built or campaigns you’ve run\n\n- Any relevant tools, APIs, or automations you’ve used\n\n- Your availability and preferred working arrangement (hourly? monthly retainer?)\n\nLet’s grow these businesses—systematically, scalably, and profitably. 🚀\n\nThanks for your time and good luck!\n\nVic Dorfman\nFounder - MemberFix, MemberHost\n\np.s. no agencies, please. I'm looking to bring somebody onto our team.",

This is not a research toy; it must place real calls at scale, qualify, log to GoHighLevel, and stay inside TCPA/TSR and state recording laws. Stack we expect: Vapi.ai or Retell, Twilio (DIDs, SIP, STIR/SHAKEN, CNAM), Node.js/Python, GoHighLevel (webhooks/API), n8n for orchestration.\n\nWe prefer practitioners who have shipped outbound voice systems, understand number reputation, and can show live artifacts (not slides).\n\nScope (initial SOW)\n\nVoice Agent & Flows\n\nOutbound agent on Vapi or Retell with barge-in, escalation, and fallbacks.\n\nBranching script for MCA qualification (funding need, monthly revenue band, time in business, negative days, # open positions/holdback %, industry).\n\nVoicemail handling, retry/backoff, and callback scheduling.\n\nTelephony & Reputation\n\nTwilio setup: local-presence number pools, CNAM registration, STIR/SHAKEN attestation strategy, answer-rate and spam-flag monitoring, dial-window enforcement across US time zones.\n\nCRM & Orchestration\n\nGoHighLevel integration (contacts/opportunities, transcripts, recordings, consent flags).\n\nCanonical funnel events: Dialed → Connected → Qualified → AppStarted → AppComplete → Offer → Funded.\n\nn8n workflows for post-call automations (tagging, SMS/email, routing).\n\nCompliance & Logging\n\nDNC/TCPA gates, opt-out handling (voice/SMS STOP/email), recording-consent line with two-party branching.\n\nStructured logs, daily exports, and dashboards for answer rate, connect rate, qual rate, cost per connected call.\n\nDocs & Handoff\n\nRunbook, env/config docs, credential inventory, and deployment instructions.\n\nAll infra runs in our Twilio/GHL/cloud; code in our repo.\n\nAcceptance Criteria (MVP)\n\n500–1,000 test contacts processed with zero DNC violations; ≥95% field capture accuracy; working consent line/state branching.\n\nGHL shows contacts/opportunities + transcripts/recordings + event trail for all calls.\n\nDaily CSV/JSON export: volume, answer rate, connected minutes, qualified count, cost per connected call.\n\nClear playbook for SHAKEN/CNAM, number rotation, and spam-flag remediation.\n\nHow to Apply (read carefully — proposals that miss items will be archived)\n\nStart your first line with: Pineapple 112\n(Do not explain it. Just start with that exact string.)\n\nA) Two-sentence credibility check\n\nIn exactly two sentences, describe one outbound voice project that failed at first and what you changed to fix it.\n\nB) 5–7 minute unedited Loom (mandatory)\n\nSay the phrase in the first 30 seconds. Show:\n\nA live outbound test call from your stack to your phone, do one barge-in + one branch.\n\nTwilio screens for number pools/CNAM/attestation (blur secrets) + where you monitor reputation.\n\nA GoHighLevel webhook/API log receiving structured outcomes.\n\nOne n8n flow reacting to a call event and updating GHL (note/tag/SMS).\n\nC) Architecture & Flow (concise bullets or a PNG diagram)\n\nInclude:\n\nVapi vs Retell choice for outbound at scale and why.\n\nConcurrency model (pacing, retries, backoff) and how you avoid reputation burn.\n\nLocal presence + time windows; include one explicit rule (e.g., handling 212 on Fridays).\n\nFailure handling for ASR/TTS errors, voicemail detection, and recontact logic.\n\nD) Compliance & Reputation Playbook\n\nYour DNC/TCPA/TSR approach: where you source scrubs, how you store consent proof, and opt-out flows (voice/SMS/email).\n\nRecording consent: the exact disclosure line you’ll use for two-party states and branching behavior.\n\nSTIR/SHAKEN: how you get A/B attestation, CNAM registration, and your remediation steps when flagged.\n\nName the tools/dashboards you use to monitor reputation and the thresholds that trigger number rotation.\n\nE) Data & Integrations (show your homework)\n\nPropose a GoHighLevel field map for contact/opportunity and the event names we’ll use.\n\nPaste two sample webhook JSON payloads you will emit:\n\nconnected (with captured fields + consent pointer).\n\nqualified (with transcript URL + recording URL).\n\nPaste a Node.js (CommonJS) Express snippet (no TypeScript, no frameworks beyond Express) handling a Vapi/Retell event and posting to GHL.\n\nInclude one n8n workflow export snippet or screenshot: HTTP In → transform → GHL Note/Tag → conditional SMS.\n\nF) Cost Model (numbers must reconcile)\n\nAssume 100,000 connected calls/month, 2.5 min average connected duration. Provide a line-item estimate:\n\nTwilio per-minute, number rental, CNAM; your answer-rate assumptions.\n\nVapi/Retell, STT/TTS provider, storage for recordings/transcripts.\n\nCompute cost per connected call and cost per qualified at 3%, 5%, 8% qualify rates.\n\nList exactly 3 levers to get under $0.20/call and the tradeoff of each.\n\nG) Anti-leak & Attribution\n\nOutline a call fingerprinting approach (per-lead HMAC in links/docs). Paste a 10–20 line server-side validator (any language) that checks the token and flags mismatches.\n\nH) Security & Ops\n\nWhere recordings/transcripts live; paste an example S3 bucket policy using SSE-KMS and a lifecycle rule.\n\nPaste one example log line and one SQL (or JSONata) query that computes Connect→Qualified by opener variant for yesterday’s cohort.\n\nState your on-call/incident routine and hotfix approach for a broken dial window or DNC gate.\n\nI) Delivery Plan & Availability\n\n3-week MVP: dated milestones + acceptance criteria aligned to the section above.\n\nWeeks 4–8: the first three improvements you’d ship and why (e.g., A/B harness, number reputation, doc collection, n8n automations).\n\nTeam shape (roles/hours/week), timezone in ISO offset (e.g., -05:00), and your weekly availability in America/Chicago business hours.\n\nConfirm all code/infrastructure run in our Twilio/GHL/cloud and code lands in our repo.\n\nEnd your proposal with this exact line:\nI have read this spec end-to-end and did not use a template.\n\nNice-to-haves\n\nExperience with bank statement parsing (negative days / ADB).\n\nPrior MCA, lending, insurance, or regulated calling experience.\n\nFamiliar with answer rate rehab and branded calling.\n\nGround Rules\n\nWe are not running a paid pilot at this time.
